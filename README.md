# random-inspiration
An inspirational poster generator intended as a scaffolded web development teaching project

Plans for this project:

[x] Create a box that will contain the random quote
[x] Create or call on a list of quotes
[x] Write a function that, when called, displays one random quote
[x] Call that function when a certain action is taken (button click, etc.)
[x] Create an array of random, inspirational poster-like images
[x] Randomly apply one of those images when the same function is called
[ ] Create an API for quotes and images
[ ] Rewrite this in React
[ ] Allow users to add quotes/images to the current list
[ ] Apply thoughtful design
